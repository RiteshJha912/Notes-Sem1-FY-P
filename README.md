## SVU - 2023 (P - Physics Group all Theory Notes and Lab Experiments)

This repository has been set up to provide easy access to the notes and lab assignments of First Year Engineering students at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering. These resources are from the P group (Physics Group), which are common for all FY students, irrespective of their branch. The aim is to give back to my juniors by making these resources easily accessible to them.

This repository is also open to collaboration. We are looking for contributors who can help expand the resources and improve the variety of notes and assignments available. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to reach out!
